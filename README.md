Using Markdown in clinical notes
==================================

# Motivation
This respository is example how simple change could improve discoverability of data in the existing clinical sources

# Idea
Main idea is to propose using Markdown in the clinical sources which could easiely create structured and formatted information which still semi-structured and require less teaching of the data entry operators, but has better structure then existing text. Currently on the market there a lot of good tools on any programming language which allow create formatted text out of Markdown.

# Examples

- [Clinical note with text](notes/note1.txt)
- [Clinical note with Markdown](notes/note1.md)
